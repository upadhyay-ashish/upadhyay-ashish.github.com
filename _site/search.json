Git clone perceives the chained commands as its own continuation, i.e. as a destination directory, unless I run it from the command line.  As we couldn’t find any references or solutions to this problem on the internet, I put a hack to capistrano code, so git clone is executed separately.

First you’ll move the tags so they’re actual tags rather than strange remote branches, and then you’ll move the rest of the branches so they’re local. To move the tags to be proper Git tags, run This takes the references that were remote branches that started with tag/ and makes them real (lightweight) tags. Next, move the rest of the references under refs/remotes to be local branches: Now all the old branches are real Git branches and all the old tags are real Git tags.
